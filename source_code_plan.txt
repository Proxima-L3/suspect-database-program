 #### Pseudocode ####




 Define constants for main menu options

 Define main function:
    - define all parallel "descriptor lists" and a list to hold all of the descriptor lists
    - preloop operations
    - main program while loop with menu options and goodbye message

 Define display menu function:
    - displays menu options and accepts user choice

 Define function that displays the database of suspects:
    - prints categories at top
    - nested for loop that takes every suspect's descriptors and puts them in a string and prints it

 Define a name search function that accepts user input and searches the database to find if the suspect is in the system:
    - use a for loop to search the first and last name lists for the entered names
    - if else statement that displays the suspects descriptors if they are in the system or prints a message telling the
        user that the suspect is not in the system

 Define a search again function:
    - after the user is done with a search they will be allowed to search again

 Define function that allows the user to search suspect by descriptors:
    - print instruction message
    - accept user input for all descriptors and save them to temporary variables
    - use a series of for loops and conditionals to search each descriptor list for the entered descriptors. If
        a descriptor is found at a certain index position, a tally will be added to the corresponding index of
        a temporary list called matches. When all the descriptor list have been iterated through, a mathematical
        operation will be done to convert each tally into a "match" percentage. If the match is over 49% it will
        be displayed to the user.
